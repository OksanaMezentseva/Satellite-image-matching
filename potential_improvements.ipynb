    "# Report: Potential Improvements for Satellite Image Matching Task\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The objective of Task 2 was to develop and train a feature-matching algorithm for satellite images captured in different seasons and locations. Despite significant progress in data preparation and pipeline design, the training process could not be completed due to resource constraints on the local machine. This document outlines insights and recommendations for improving the performance and results of the model."

    "## Proposed Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Cloud-Based Training\n",
    "- Set up the project on platforms like Google Colab or Kaggle, where free GPUs are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dataset Optimization\n",
    "- Preprocess images to reduce their resolution and size.\n",
    "- Implement caching and efficient data loaders to minimize the memory footprint during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Model Improvements\n",
    "- Experiment with alternative architectures, such as CNN-based feature extraction models.\n",
    "- Fine-tune pre-trained models for feature matching instead of building a pipeline from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Inference and Evaluation\n",
    "- Test the pipeline on small datasets to verify its correctness.\n",
    "- Use visualizations and metrics like feature-matching accuracy and recall to evaluate performance."
